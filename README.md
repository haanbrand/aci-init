# aci-init
To quickly initialise an ACI fabric with policies etc

    ***This will initialize the fabric on APIC with IP: {apic} ***
    
    Make sure the spreadsheet "fabric_init.xlsx" is populated correctly...
    
    In each section before config will be applied the always present 
    "Yes/No" to proceed question will be asked...
    
    Have fun.
